# Environment Variables System Summary

## Overview

The Gurukul Volunteer Attendance Tracker now has a comprehensive environment variable system that supports multiple deployment platforms and provides secure credential management.

## ✅ What's Working

### 1. Netlify Environment Variables Support
- **Build-time injection**: Environment variables are injected during Netlify build process
- **Runtime API fallback**: If build-time injection fails, credentials are loaded from Netlify Functions
- **Automatic detection**: System automatically detects Netlify deployment and uses appropriate method

### 2. Multiple Variable Name Support
The system supports various naming conventions:
- `GOOGLE_OAUTH_CLIENT_ID` (Primary for Netlify)
- `GOOGLE_SHEETS_API_KEY` (Primary for Netlify)  
- `VOLUNTEER_SPREADSHEET_ID` (Primary for Netlify)
- Plus React, Vite, and Next.js prefixed versions

### 3. Deployment Platform Support
- **Netlify**: Full environment variable support with build-time injection
- **GitHub Pages**: Uses local-env.js for development
- **Vercel**: API endpoint for secure credential serving
- **Local Development**: local-env.js with test credentials

## 🔧 How It Works

### Environment Variable Loading Priority

1. **Netlify Build-time Injection** (Production)
   - Variables set in Netlify dashboard
   - Injected into `netlify-env.js` during build
   - Highest priority for Netlify deployments

2. **Netlify Functions API** (Fallback)
   - Server-side function serves credentials
   - Used if build-time injection fails
   - Endpoint: `/.netlify/functions/credentials`

3. **Local Environment** (Development)
   - `local-env.js` with test credentials
   - Used for local development
   - Lowest priority

4. **User Settings** (Override)
   - Stored in browser's secure storage
   - Can override environment variables
   - Managed through settings page

### File Structure

```
js/
├── local-env.js                 # Local development credentials
├── netlify-env.js              # Generated by build process (Netlify)
├── core/
│   ├── environment-config.js   # Variable name mappings
│   ├── credential-manager.js   # Main credential management
│   ├── environment.js          # Environment detection
│   └── netlify-credentials.js  # Netlify Functions API client
├── netlify/

│       └── credentials.js      # Netlify Functions endpoint
└── api/
    └── credentials.js          # Vercel API endpoint
```

## 🌐 Netlify Configuration

### Required Environment Variables in Netlify Dashboard

| Variable | Description | Required |
|----------|-------------|----------|
| `GOOGLE_OAUTH_CLIENT_ID` | Google OAuth 2.0 Client ID | ✅ Yes |
| `GOOGLE_SHEETS_API_KEY` | Google Sheets API Key | ✅ Yes |
| `VOLUNTEER_SPREADSHEET_ID` | Spreadsheet ID | ⚠️ Optional |

### Build Configuration (netlify.toml)

```toml
[build]
  publish = "."
  functions = "netlify/functions"
  command = "node netlify-env-inject.js"

[build.environment]
  NODE_VERSION = "18"
```

### Build Process

1. Netlify runs `netlify-env-inject.js`
2. Script reads environment variables from `process.env`
3. Generates `js/netlify-env.js` with credentials
4. Updates `index.html` to include the script
5. Deploys the site with injected credentials

## 🧪 Testing

### Test Page: `/test-env-vars.html`

The test page verifies:
- ✅ Environment variable loading from all sources
- ✅ Credential validation and format checking
- ✅ Netlify Functions API connectivity
- ✅ Build-time injection detection
- ✅ Deployment environment detection

### Running Tests

1. **Local Testing**:
   ```bash
   python3 -m http.server 8080
   # Visit: http://localhost:8080/test-env-vars.html
   ```

2. **Production Testing**:
   ```
   # Visit: https://gurukul-attendance.netlify.app/test-env-vars.html
   ```

## 🔒 Security Features

### Build-time Injection Security
- Variables are injected server-side during build
- No client-side API calls for credentials
- Credentials are bundled with the application

### Runtime API Security  
- CORS protection with allowed origins
- Request origin validation
- Server-side credential storage only

### User Override Security
- Credentials encrypted in browser storage
- Device-specific encryption keys
- Automatic expiration (30 days)

## 📋 Setup Checklist

### For Netlify Deployment

- [ ] Set `GOOGLE_OAUTH_CLIENT_ID` in Netlify dashboard
- [ ] Set `GOOGLE_SHEETS_API_KEY` in Netlify dashboard  
- [ ] Set `VOLUNTEER_SPREADSHEET_ID` in Netlify dashboard (optional)
- [ ] Verify `netlify.toml` has correct build command
- [ ] Deploy and test with `/test-env-vars.html`
- [ ] Verify main application loads credentials correctly

### For Local Development

- [ ] Update `js/local-env.js` with test credentials
- [ ] Start local server (`python3 -m http.server 8080`)
- [ ] Test with `/test-env-vars.html`
- [ ] Verify application works with test data

## 🚨 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **"No environment variables found"**
   - Check Netlify dashboard for variable configuration
   - Verify build process completed successfully
   - Check build logs for injection script errors

2. **"Credential validation failed"**
   - Verify API key format (starts with `AIza`)
   - Verify Client ID format (ends with `.googleusercontent.com`)
   - Check for extra spaces or quotes in values

3. **"Netlify Functions API not available"**
   - Verify `netlify.toml` configuration
   - Check if functions are deployed correctly
   - Test endpoint directly: `/.netlify/functions/credentials`

### Debug Steps

1. **Check Browser Console**:
   - Look for credential loading messages
   - Verify environment injection markers
   - Check for validation errors

2. **Test Environment Variables**:
   - Visit `/test-env-vars.html`
   - Run all tests and check results
   - Verify expected vs actual values

3. **Check Build Logs**:
   - Review Netlify build logs
   - Look for environment injection messages
   - Verify script execution

## 📈 Performance Impact

### Build-time Injection (Recommended)
- ✅ No runtime API calls
- ✅ Fastest credential loading
- ✅ Works offline
- ✅ No additional network requests

### Runtime API Fallback
- ⚠️ Additional API call on startup
- ⚠️ Requires network connectivity
- ✅ More flexible for updates
- ✅ Server-side security

## 🔄 Migration Guide

### From Manual Configuration
1. Set environment variables in Netlify dashboard
2. Remove hardcoded credentials from code
3. Deploy and test with new system

### From Other Platforms
1. Copy environment variable values
2. Set in Netlify dashboard with correct names
3. Update any platform-specific configurations
4. Test deployment and functionality
