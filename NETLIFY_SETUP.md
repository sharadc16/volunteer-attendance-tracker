# 🚀 Netlify Secure Credential Setup

Since you're already using Netlify, here's how to add secure credential management without any additional services.

## 🔧 Step 1: Deploy to Netlify (if not already done)

1. **Connect your GitHub repo to Netlify:**
   - Go to [netlify.com](https://netlify.com)
   - Click "New site from Git"
   - Connect your GitHub repo
   - Build settings:
     - Build command: `echo "Static site"`
     - Publish directory: `.`

2. **Your site will be available at:** `https://your-site-name.netlify.app`

## 🔐 Step 2: Add Environment Variables

1. **Go to Netlify Dashboard:**
   - Select your site
   - Go to **Site settings > Environment variables**

2. **Add these variables:**
   ```
   GOOGLE_SHEETS_API_KEY = your_google_sheets_api_key
   GOOGLE_OAUTH_CLIENT_ID = your_google_oauth_client_id  
   VOLUNTEER_SPREADSHEET_ID = your_spreadsheet_id
   BACKUP_SPREADSHEET_ID = your_backup_spreadsheet_id (optional)
   ```

## 🧪 Step 3: Test Your Setup

1. **Deploy your changes:**
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Add Netlify Functions for secure credentials"
   git push origin main
   ```

2. **Test the credential API:**
   ```bash
   # Test your Netlify function directly
   curl https://your-site-name.netlify.app/.netlify/functions/credentials
   ```

3. **Test in browser console:**
   ```javascript
   // Test server credential loading
   await window.serverCredentialManager.initialize();
   const apiKey = await window.serverCredentialManager.getCredential('google_sheets_api_key');
   console.log('API Key loaded:', !!apiKey);
   ```

## 🔒 Security Benefits

✅ **API keys stored securely** in Netlify environment variables  
✅ **Never exposed** in client-side code  
✅ **CORS protection** - only your domain can access  
✅ **No additional services** - uses your existing Netlify setup  
✅ **Automatic HTTPS** - all requests encrypted  

## 🚨 Troubleshooting

### "Function not found" error
- Check that `netlify/functions/credentials.js` exists
- Verify Netlify build completed successfully
- Check Netlify function logs in dashboard

### "Environment variables not set"
- Go to Netlify dashboard > Site settings > Environment variables
- Verify all required variables are added
- Redeploy after adding variables

### CORS errors
- Check that your domain is in the allowed origins list
- Verify the function is returning proper CORS headers

## 🎯 What Happens Now

1. **Users visit your site** (GitHub Pages or Netlify)
2. **Frontend automatically fetches credentials** from Netlify Functions
3. **No user prompts** for API keys - everything loads automatically
4. **API keys stay secure** on Netlify servers

## 📱 User Experience

**Before:** Users had to enter API keys in every browser  
**After:** Zero setup - credentials load automatically and securely
