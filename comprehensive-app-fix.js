üîß MANUAL FIX INSTRUCTIONS:

The app.js file has multiple methods that are outside the VolunteerAttendanceApp class.
Each method needs to be properly closed and added to the prototype.

For each method that has a syntax error:

1. Find the method definition (e.g., "async methodName() {")
2. Find where the previous method should end
3. Add "};" to close the previous method
4. Change the method definition to:
   "VolunteerAttendanceApp.prototype.methodName = async function() {"
5. At the end of the method, change "}" to "};"

Example fix:
BEFORE:
    } // end of previous method
    
    async testMethod() {
        // method content
    }

AFTER:
    }; // properly close previous method
    
    VolunteerAttendanceApp.prototype.testMethod = async function() {
        // method content  
    };

This needs to be done for all methods that are causing syntax errors.

// Test if we can access the methods that should exist

        } else {
            console.log(`‚ùå ${method} is missing from prototype`);
        }
